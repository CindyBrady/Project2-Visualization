# Project2-Visualization

##Our group chose to use mock data from a store, The Great Outdoors. The dataset contains store information, product information, recent orders, store location, and sales and revenue prices. We will store this data in a SQL-Lite database and utilize the database to create a flask app.

###We plan to use leaflet to build a geomap where we will place markers on store locations and display store sales data.

###We will use D3 to visualize sales data with a line graph.

###Dashboarding will be done in Google Data Studio or Power BI. 

##Our project will have a home page and about page with a short description of our project, an introduction to our project group members, and an intro to our project pages. We plan to include three visualizations, which will result in a total of four pages. The page will have a navigation bar for page interaction. The first link will be a map with pins (markers) demonstrating store locations and each marker will include a custom tooltip with data pertaining to that particular storeâ€™s sales. The second page will be a D3 visualization, revenue vs time line graph, or a revenue vs store (to visualize how each store is doing) or revenue vs quantity (to see how each product is selling overall). The third page will be a dashboard that we will deploy using iFrame.. The dashboard will include visualizations pertaining to sales data, month-to-month and YOY, total revenue (by location),  product insights (which products do well in certain regions), and store insights (which stores are doing well and which are falling behind).
